This is an attempt to pay back the f123 folks for the original idea behind fluxable-newmenu which has now grown in to a notably improved script.
this will become an AUR package shortly, but for now is solely uploaded so the the f123 project can use it for their next distro release.
Thanks again to Fernando and Kyle.
